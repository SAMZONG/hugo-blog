## <font color=red>Install Mysql 5.5 on RHEL/CentOS 5/6/7 </font>

### **Setup 1. Use Repository.**

First, to set up the yum repository, install the mysql－community-server 5.5 RPM based on your CentOS/RHEL release: <br>

---
#### **mysql-server-5.5.repo for CentOS/RHEL 5.x**
```
rpm -Uvh http://mirror.webtatic.com/yum/el5/latest.rpm
```
#### * **Only Install MySQL 5.5 On CentOS 5.x**
If you already have MySql client or server installed (rpm -q mysql mysql-server), then you can upgrade using the following method:<br>
```
yum install mysql.`uname -i` yum-plugin-replace
yum replace mysql --replace-with mysql55w
```

“yum install mysql” is only there to make sure yum-plugin-replace can resolve dependencies correctly if only mysql-server was installed.<br>
Otherwise, to install MySql client and server, then run:<br>
```
yum install mysql55w mysql55w-server
```

#### **mysql-server-5.5.repo for CentOS/RHEL 6.x**
```
# For x86_64
yum install http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.5-community/el/6/x86_64/mysql-community-release-el6-5.noarch.rpm

# For i386

```

### **Setup 2. Install MySQL Server 5.5**
If you already have MySql client or server installed (rpm -q mysql mysql-server), then you must uninstall using the following method:<br>

yum remove -y mysql-server
yum remove -y mysql*
```

If you don't have mysql-server was installed.<br>
Otherwise, to install MySql client and server, then run:<br>
```
yum install -y mysql-community-server
```

### **Setup 3. Service Configure**
You should upgrade existing tables before setting the server to become a production machine, which can be done by starting the server and running the mysql_upgrade script (this may take time depending on the size of the database).<br>
```
service mysqld start
```
This will issue a password prompt for the user. If you don't have a root user password, remove the "-p"<br>
